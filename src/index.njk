<h1>hey there.</h1>

<div class="p-summary  intro">
  <p>
    I'm Bea David, a full stack web developer. I love to build web applications with just one step or less.<br />
    In my free time I enjoy to stay on top of horses, motor bikes and hills. That's not always easy, but so far I'm happy with the outcome.
